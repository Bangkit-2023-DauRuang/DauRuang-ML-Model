# DauRuang
This is Bangkit Final Capstone Project by Team C23-PC699

DauRuang (Ruang Daur Ulang Menghasilkan Uang)
We chose this name of "DauRuang" because first, the word "Daur" is taken from recycling or which means according to KBBI, namely the activity or reprocessing of materials that have been used. This is in accordance with the project we want to develop, namely recycling materials or waste, ranging from plastic to used cooking oil. Then, the word "Uang" is taken from the income generated from the collection of used waste itself. Also, in the title of our project there we also emphasize the word "R" in "DauRuang" because space itself means a place or place for people who care about the sustainability of the environment to collect leftovers to be collected at the nearest waste collectors centers.
